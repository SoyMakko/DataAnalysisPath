####################### Objects and classes

# Class attributes (class_attribute = value)

# Class attributes are variables shared among all class instances (objects).
# They are defined within the class but outside of any methods.

# The __init__ method is a special method known as the constructor.It initializes the instance attributes (also called instance variables) when an object is created.

# The self parameter is the first parameter of the constructor, referring to the instance being created.
# attribute1, attribute2, and so on are parameters passed to the constructor when creating an object.
# Inside the constructor, self.attribute1, self.attribute2, and so on are used to assign values to instance attributes.
